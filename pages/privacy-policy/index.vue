      will be retained and used for a maximum period of 2 years in our database,

       Within the company, candidate data will be shared with all people
      included in the recruitment process. Alero operates in several

      comply with relevant legislation described in our Privacy policy.
      Candidate data may be shared with our affiliates, subsidiaries and/or
      sister companies, to consider you for other current or future jobs and
      potentially include you in recruitment process. If you have been referred
      for a job at Alero by a current Alero employee, with your consent,
      we may inform that employee about the progress of your application and let
      the Alero employee know the outcome of the process. In some cases, if
      it is identified that you have attended the same university/school or
      shared the same previous employer during the same period as a current
      Alero employee, we may consult with that employee for feedback on you.
      We use TalentLyft and Google, as our third party data processor to process
      candidate data on our behalf, as described in their privacy policy.
